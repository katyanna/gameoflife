"Conway's Game of life was created in 1970 by a British mathematician called John Conway. John Conway
extended the work of John von Neumann who had created a machine that operated on a board that could
create copies of itself. The rules that Neumann's machine operated under were much more complicated
than the rules in Conway's Game of Life.
The game of life become very famous soon after it's creation. Many become fascinated by the fact that
the very simple rules that the cells operate under could create order out of chaos and that so
complicated patterns could evolve. When home computers become popular soon after the game was
published, a lot of implementations become available and the game become a popular screen server."
